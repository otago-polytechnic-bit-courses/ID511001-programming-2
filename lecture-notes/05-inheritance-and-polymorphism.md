# 05: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class, called the base class or the parent class. The new class, called the derived class or the child class, can inherit all or some of the base class members and can also add new members or override existing members.

Inheritance is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, along with encapsulation and polymorphism. It allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where a derived class inherits the properties and methods of its base class and can add new properties and methods or override existing ones.

Here's an example of inheritance:

```cs
public class Animal
{
    protected string name;
    protected int age;

    public Animal(string name, int age)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Virtual - derived classes can override the base class implementation
    public virtual string Eat() { /*...*/ }
    public virtual string Sleep() { /*...*/ }

    public virtual string Name { get => name; set => name = value; }
    public int Age { get => age; set => age = value; } 
}
```

```cs
public class Dog : Animal
{
    // Adding a new field
    private string _colour;

    public Dog(string name, int age, string colour) : base(name, age) // The base class's constructor
    {
        _colour = colour;
    }

    // Overriding the base class's implementation
    public override string Eat() { /*...*/ }

    // Its own class method
    public string Bark() { /*...*/ }

    public override string Name { get => name; set => name = value; }
    public string Colour { get => _colour; set => _colour = value; }
}
```

In this example, the `Animal` class is the base class. It has two fields, `name` and `age`, two properties, `Name` and `Age` and two virtual methods `Eat()` and `Sleep()`.

The `Dog` class is the derived class. It inherits the base class's fields and methods and has a new method, `Bark()`. A derived class can also override the base class's methods and properties
using the `override` keyword.

Let us look at how to use a base and derived class in C#:

```cs
public Form1() 
{
    InitializeComponent();

    Animal animal = new("Bob", 10); // Base class
    MessageBox.Show(animal.Name); // Base class's property

    Dog dog = new("Fido", 5, "Brown"); // Derived class
    MessageBox.Show(dog.Colour); // Base class's property
}
```

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a mechanism that allows a single method or property to have multiple forms or behaviours. It is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and inheritance.

There are two types of polymorphism:

1. Compile-time polymorphism: also known as static polymorphism or overloading. It allows different methods to have the same name but different signatures (number, type, or order of parameters). It is achieved by **method overloading**, **operator overloading**, and **constructor overloading**.
2. Run-time polymorphism: also known as dynamic polymorphism or overriding. It allows a derived class to provide a different implementation of a method already defined in its base class. It is achieved by method overriding, requiring the `virtual` and `override` keywords.

Here is an example of **polymorphism** using **method overloading**:

```cs
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int x, int y) => x + y;
    public double Add(double x, double y) => x + y;
}
```

In this example, the `Calculator` class has two methods called `Add()` that have the same name but different signatures. The first one takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum, and the second takes two doubles as arguments and returns their sum.

Here is an example of **polymorphism** using **virtual** method and **method overriding**:

```cs
public class Shape
{
    public virtual string Draw() => "Drawing a shape";
}
```

```cs
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override string Draw() => "Drawing a rectangle";
}
```

```cs
public class Circle : Shape
{
    // Notice that the Draw() method is not overridden in the Circle class
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` class is the base class, and it has a `virtual` method `Draw()`, that outputs "Drawing a shape". The `Rectangle` class and `Circle` class are derived classes. They both inherit the `Draw()` method from the base class and then override it to provide their implementation. The `Rectangle` class will output "Drawing a rectangle".

Here is an example of **polymorphism** using **abstract** classes and **method overriding**:

```cs
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract string Draw();
}
```

```cs
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override string Draw() => "Drawing a rectangle";
}
```

```cs
public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override string Draw() => "Drawing a circle";
}
```

You can declare `virtual` and `abstract` methods in the same class. However, you cannot declare a method as both `virtual` and `abstract`. The following code will not compile:

```cs
public abstract class Shape
{
    public virtual abstract string Draw();
}
```

**What is the difference?**

The `virtual` method in the original code provides a default implementation for the `Draw()` method in the `Shape` class, which can be overridden in any derived classes if necessary. The `abstract` method, i.e., `Draw()` method, does not provide any default implementation in the `Shape` class. Instead, it requires any derived classes to implement the `Draw()` method, making it mandatory for them to provide their own implementation.

# Formative Assessment

Before you start, create a new **Windows Forms Application** called **05-formative-assessment**.

If you get stuck on any of the following tasks, feel free to use **ChatGPT** permitting, you are aware of the following:

- If you provide **ChatGPT** with a prompt that is not refined enough, it may generate a not-so-useful response
- Do not trust **ChatGPT's** responses blindly. You must still use your judgement and may need to do additional research to determine if the response is correct
- Acknowledge that you are using **ChatGPT**. In the **README.md** file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to **ChatGPT** and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work

## Task 1:

Create a base class called `Vehicle` with the `protected` fields - `brand`, `model`, and `year`. Create a constructor method that accepts all fields. Create a `virtual` method called `DisplayDetails` that returna a `string` which displays the `Vehicle`'s `brand`, `model`, and `year`.

Create a class called `Car` which derives from `Vehicle` with the private field - `numOfDoors`. Create a constructor that accepts all base class's fields, i.e., `brand`, `model`, and `year` and its own, i.e., `numOfDoors`. Create an `override` method for `DisplayDetails` which displays the `Car`s `numOfDoors`.

In the `Form1()` constructor, create two `Car` objects. Using the `MessageBox.Show()` method, call the `DisplayDetails` method for each `Car`.

## Task 2:

Extend the `Animal` and `Dog` example to include a derived class called `Cat`.

In the `Form1()` constructor, create a `Dog` and `Cat` object. Using the `MessageBox.Show()` method, call the `Eat` and `Sleep` methods for each `Dog` and `Cat`.

## Task 3:

Create a base class called `Person` with the `protected` fields - `name` and `age`. Create a constructor method that accepts all fields. Create a `virtual` method that returns a `string` called `DisplayDetails` which outputs the `Person`'s `name` and `age`.

Create a class called `Student` which derives from `Person` with the private field - `grade`. Create a constructor that accepts all base class's fields, i.e., `name` and `age` and its own, i.e., `grade`. Create an `override` method for `DisplayDetails` which outputs the `Student`'s `name`, `age` and `grade`.

Create a class called `Lecturer` which derives from `Person` with the private field - `subject`. Create a constructor that accepts all base class's fields, i.e., `name` and `age` and its own, i.e., `subject`. Create an `override` method for `DisplayDetails` which outputs the `Lecturer`'s `name`, `age` and `subject`.

In the `Form1()` constructor, create a `Person`, `Student` and `Lecturer` object. Using the `MessageBox.Show()` method, call the `DisplayDetails` method for each `Person`, `Student` and `Lecturer`.

## Task 4:

In this task, you will create an application that prompts the user to select a shape and return the area of that shape.

Here are steps you should consider:

1. Declare a base class called Shape that contains a `virtual` method called `CalculateArea()` that returns a `double`.
2. Declare two derived classes called `Rectangle` and `Circle` that inherit from the `Shape` base class.
3. Implement the `CalculateArea()` method in the `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes to calculate the area of a rectangle and a circle respectively.
4. Prompt the user using a `TextBox` to select a shape from the list of shapes.
5. Parse the user's input and create an instance of the selected shape.
6. Prompt the user using a `TextBox` or `TextBoxes` to enter the required dimensions of the selected shape. For example, if the user selects a rectangle, the application should prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
7. Calculate the area of the selected shape using polymorphism by calling the `CalculateArea()` method on the shape object created in step 5.
8. Output the area of the selected shape in a `Label`.
9. Add error handling to the application to handle invalid input. If the user enters invalid input, the application should output "Invalid input. Please try again." and prompt the user to enter valid input.
