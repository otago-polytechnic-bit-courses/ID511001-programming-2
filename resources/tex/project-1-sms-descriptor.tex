\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Wednesday, 20 September 2023} at \textbf{4.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID511001: Programming 2}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. If you use code snippets from \textbf{GitHub}, \textbf{StackOverflow} or other online resources, you \textbf{must} reference it appropriately using \textbf{APA 7th edition}. Provide your references in the \textbf{README.md} file in your repository. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment. 

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all app files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/xIHtZr71}{https://classroom.github.com/a/xIHtZr71}.  Create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/VisualStudio.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/VisualStudio.gitignore}. The latest app files in the \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. Contact the course lecturer before the due date if you need an extension. If you require more than a week's extension, you will need to provide a medical certificate or support letter from your manager.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame and usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity and achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID511001: Programming 2}.

\section*{Instructions}
You will need to submit an app and documentation that meet the following requirements:\\

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcomes 1 and 2 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The app \textbf{must} open without code or file structure modification in \textbf{Visual Studio}.
    \item Create the following classes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{AssessmentMarks} which has the following field:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{assessmentMarks} of type \textbf{List$<$int$>$}
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Person} which is an \textbf{abstract} class and has the following fields and method:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{id} of type \textbf{int}
            \item \textbf{firstName} of type \textbf{string}
            \item \textbf{lastName} of type \textbf{string}
            \item \textbf{DisplayDetails()} which is a \textbf{public abstract} method, has no arguments and returns a \textbf{string}
        \end{itemize}    
        \item \textbf{Learner} which inherits from \textbf{Person} and has the following additional fields and method:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{prog1AssessmentMarks} of type \textbf{AssessmentMarks}
            \item \textbf{prog2AssessmentMarks} of type \textbf{AssessmentMarks}

        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Lecturer} which inherits from \textbf{Person} and has the following additional fields and method:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{position} of type \textbf{string}
            \item \textbf{salary} of type \textbf{int}
            \item \textbf{DisplayDetails()} which is an \textbf{override} method, has no arguments and returns a \textbf{Lecturer's} \textbf{id}, \textbf{first name}, \textbf{last name}, \textbf{position} and \textbf{salary}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Read a text file called \textbf{learners.txt} which contains information about five learners. This information includes \textbf{id}, \textbf{first name}, \textbf{last name}, three \textbf{ID510001: Programming 1 assessment marks} and three \textbf{ID511001: Programming 2 assessment marks}. \textbf{Note:} \textbf{learners.txt} \textbf{must} be located in the \textbf{bin/Debug} folder.
    \item Create a \textbf{List} of \textbf{Learner} objects and populate it with the information from the \textbf{learners.txt} file.
    \item Read a text file called \textbf{lecturers.txt} which contains information about three lecturers. This information includes \textbf{id}, \textbf{first name}, \textbf{last name}, \textbf{position} and \textbf{salary}. \textbf{Note:} \textbf{lecturers.txt} \textbf{must} be located in the \textbf{bin/Debug} folder.
    \item Create a \textbf{List} of \textbf{Lecturer} objects and populate it with the information from the \textbf{lecturers.txt} file.
    \item An \textbf{AssessmentMarks} object has several behaviours such as getting all marks, all grades, highest mark(s), lowest mark(s), fail mark(s), average marks and average grades. Create the following \textbf{public} methods in the \textbf{AssessmentMarks} class:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{GetAllMarks()} which has no arguments and returns a \textbf{List$<$int$>$}

        \item \textbf{GetAverageGrade()} which has no arguments and returns a \textbf{string}
    \end{itemize}
    \item A grade is calculated using the following grade table:\\\\
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Grade} & \textbf{Mark Range} \\ \hline
        A+ & 90-100  \\ \hline
        A & 85-89  \\ \hline
        A- & 80-84 \\ \hline

        D & 40-49   \\ \hline
        E & 0-39   \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \\\\ \textbf{Note:} The \textbf{lowest passing mark} is 50. If a learner achieves a mark of 50 in each assessment, i.e., 50, 50, 50 for a course, i.e., \textbf{ID510001: Programming 1} the \textbf{lowest passing mark} is 50 and the \textbf{highest passing mark} is 50.  
    \item The app \textbf{must} display the following menu options:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1. Display all marks
        \item 2. Display all grades
        \item 3. Display highest, lowest and fail marks
        \item 4. Display average marks
        \item 5. Display average grades
        \item 6. Add a learner
        \item 7. Remove a learner
        \item 8. Display lecturer details
        \item 0. Exit
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Note:} In the \textbf{Program.cs} file, you will need to create methods to achieve this functionality. Also, the app \textbf{must} be able to handle invalid user input. If the user enters an invalid option, a message \textbf{must} be displayed.
